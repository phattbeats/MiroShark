"""Lock in the agent-facing wire-format compaction.

The Wonderwall env dump is paid for many times — CAMEL's ChatAgent keeps
prior user messages in memory across rounds, so each post's wire bytes
get re-sent on every subsequent agent action. These tests pin the rules
that drop signal-free bytes without changing what the agent semantically
sees.

Validated end-to-end on the miroshark-api codebase: 57% reduction in avg
input tokens per simulate LLM call, 27% drop in absolute simulate cost on
a 32-agent run, no quality regression in the report.
