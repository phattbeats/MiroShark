"""Public-gallery syndication feeds — Atom 1.0 + RSS 2.0.

Serves the same cards ``GET /api/simulation/public`` returns, but as
syndication XML so research-and-tooling readers can subscribe in
Feedly / Readwise / Inoreader / Obsidian RSS / NetNewsWire — every newly
published MiroShark simulation lands in a follower's reader the same way
an AI newsletter or Substack post does.

Mounted on a dedicated blueprint at ``/api`` so the URLs stay short
(``/api/feed.atom``, ``/api/feed.rss``) and don't bury under the
``/api/simulation/...`` namespace where they'd be missed by feed
auto-discovery scripts.

Same publish gate as the gallery itself: only simulations toggled
``is_public=true`` appear, exactly the set already on /explore.

Sandbox note: pure stdlib (``xml.etree.ElementTree`` + the existing
``SimulationManager``). No outbound network — the route never raises and
never blocks on Neo4j / LLM calls.

        annotation (the ``/verified`` curated hall).
      * ``q`` — case-insensitive substring search over each simulation's
        scenario text.
      * ``consensus`` — ``bullish`` / ``neutral`` / ``bearish``; uses
        the same ±0.2 stance dominance threshold as the gallery.
      * ``quality`` — ``excellent`` / ``good`` / ``fair`` / ``poor``.
      * ``outcome`` — ``correct`` / ``incorrect`` / ``partial`` (subset
        of ``verified=1`` that further narrows on the outcome label).
      * ``sort`` — ``date`` (default, newest first) / ``rounds`` /
        ``agents`` / ``trending`` (cumulative share-surface serves).
      * ``limit`` — 1..50; default 20.

    Unknown / invalid values fall back to the default for that knob — a
    typo'd ``?consensus=bullsih`` returns the full feed rather than an
    empty one, matching the gallery's "graceful degradation" contract.
