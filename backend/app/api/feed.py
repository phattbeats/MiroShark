"""Public-gallery syndication feeds — Atom 1.0 + RSS 2.0.

Serves the same cards ``GET /api/simulation/public`` returns, but as
syndication XML so research-and-tooling readers can subscribe in
Feedly / Readwise / Inoreader / Obsidian RSS / NetNewsWire — every newly
published MiroShark simulation lands in a follower's reader the same way
an AI newsletter or Substack post does.

Mounted on a dedicated blueprint at ``/api`` so the URLs stay short
(``/api/feed.atom``, ``/api/feed.rss``) and don't bury under the
``/api/simulation/...`` namespace where they'd be missed by feed
auto-discovery scripts.

Same publish gate as the gallery itself: only simulations toggled
``is_public=true`` appear, exactly the set already on /explore.

Sandbox note: pure stdlib (``xml.etree.ElementTree`` + the existing
``SimulationManager``). No outbound network — the route never raises and
never blocks on Neo4j / LLM calls.
