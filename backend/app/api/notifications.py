"""Public ``GET /api/config/notifications`` config endpoint.

Tells the SPA which notification *channels* are wired up on this
deployment without exposing the values themselves (the webhook URLs
often carry an opaque secret in the path). Mirrors the existing
``GET /api/config/sitemap`` pattern: a small boolean envelope the
``EmbedDialog`` reads on mount and uses to render the right status
chips beside the share-and-embed surfaces.

Three independent channels, each gated by a separate env var so
operators can opt in to any subset:

* ``WEBHOOK_URL``         — generic JSON ``POST`` (PR #46)
* ``DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`` — Discord rich-embed cards
* ``SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL``   — Slack Block Kit messages

Plus the OriginTrail DKG citation surface, which is wired up only when
all three of ``DKG_API_URL`` / ``DKG_AUTH_TOKEN`` / ``DKG_CONTEXT_GRAPH_ID``
are non-empty. The probe exposes ``dkg_configured`` and ``dkg_network``
so the EmbedDialog can render the "Publish to DKG (testnet|mainnet)"
button accordingly; the auth token itself never leaves the backend.

Each ``*_configured`` boolean is ``True`` iff the corresponding env
var is set to a non-empty value. No URL ever leaves the backend.

Sandbox note: pure stdlib (env reads + ``flask.jsonify``). No
outbound network — the route never raises and never blocks on
Neo4j / LLM calls.
